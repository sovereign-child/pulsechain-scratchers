# Scratchers: PulseChain Onboarding Through Physical Cards
*A Community White Paper – Draft v1*

---

## 1. Introduction
PulseChain is building momentum, but onboarding new users remains one of the biggest challenges. Most airdrops and giveaways are digital-only, making them vulnerable to bots and failing to create real connection.

**Scratchers** changes this by introducing **physical scratch-off cards** that are:
- Community-sponsored and funded in PLS.
- Fun, familiar, and easy to understand.
- Fully transparent and provable on-chain.

Each Scratchers card gives its holder:
- A **starter voucher** of PLS.
- A **small faucet drip** so they can pay gas.
- A **raffle entry** for the batch prize pool.

This makes onboarding **simple, tangible, and exciting** — bridging the physical and digital worlds.

## 2. Why Scratchers?
- 🎟 **Fun & Familiar** – Scratch-off cards are understood everywhere.  
- 🚫 **Anti-Bot** – Only someone holding the card can redeem it.  
- 🧾 **Transparent** – All funds and packaging costs are tracked on-chain, with receipts uploaded for verification.  
- 🔄 **Sustainable** – Surplus funds go into a buffer pool to stabilize future batches.  
- 🌍 **Scalable IRL** – Cards can be mailed, handed out at meetups, or distributed at events.

## 3. How It Works

### 3.1 Sponsors Fund a Batch
Community members contribute PLS. Each card requires:
- **100,000 PLS** for packaging (paid to vendor).  
- **100,000 PLS** for voucher value (locked in BatchVault).  
- **10,000 PLS** for raffle pot (locked in RaffleVault).  

👉 Example: A 1,000-card batch = 210M PLS.

### 3.2 Cards Are Printed
- Each card contains:  
  - **Hidden scratch code** → redemption proof.  
  - **Unique raffle ticket number** → for batch drawing.  
  - **QR code** → links to redemption dApp.  

### 3.3 Redemption Flow
1. Scratch card → reveal code.  
2. Scan QR → open redemption dApp.  
3. Connect wallet + enter code.  
4. Smart contract verifies → user receives:  
   - **100k PLS voucher value**.  
   - **100 PLS faucet drip** (if wallet is empty).  
   - **Raffle ticket activation**.  

### 3.4 Batch Raffle
- Each redeemed card = one raffle entry.  
- At batch cutoff, contract runs a **provably fair on-chain draw**.  
- **One winner** per batch receives the full raffle pot.  
- Winning ticket and wallet are displayed publicly on the dApp.

## 4. Packaging Costs & Surplus Buffer

### 4.1 Receipts Required
- Ambassadors (batch operators) must **upload receipts** (invoices, shipping docs) to IPFS.  
- Vendor payouts reference these receipt hashes on-chain.  
- Sponsors and the community can audit costs at any time.  

### 4.2 Budget & Buffer
- Each card has a **100,000 PLS budget allocation** for packaging.  
- If actual costs are **less**, the surplus flows into a shared **Buffer Pool**.  
- If costs are **more**, the Buffer Pool is tapped first. If still short, sponsors top-off.  

### 4.3 Benefits
- Creates a **transparent record** of real-world costs.  
- Ensures **future batches** can smooth out small funding gaps.  
- Builds **confidence** that every PLS is documented and accounted for.  

---

## 5. Proof-of-Physical-Distribution (PoPD)
- Primary PoPD = scratch code itself. Only someone with the card can redeem.  
- Optional enhancements for future phases:  
  - Serial numbers for tracking.  
  - NFC/QR validation layers.  
  - Ambassador bounties tied to unique redeemers.  

---

## 6. Governance (DAO-Lite for MVP)
Sponsors can vote on adjustments for **future batches**, including:
- Voucher size (default: 100,000 PLS).  
- Raffle contribution (default: 10,000 PLS).  
- Packaging budget (default: 100,000 PLS).  
- Surplus allocation rules (default: 100% to Buffer Pool).  

---

## 7. Benefits

### For Sponsors
- Direct, transparent impact on PulseChain adoption.  
- All funds verifiable on-chain.  
- Voting power to shape the system.  

### For Recipients
- Free starter funds and gas.

- A chance to win a raffle prize.  

### For the Ecosystem
- More wallets, more activity, more growth.  
- A repeatable onboarding model.  
- A “fun layer” for marketing, meetups, and events.
